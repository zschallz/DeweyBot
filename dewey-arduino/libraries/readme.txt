This folder contains libraries used in dewey.pde. If one is to compile dewey.pde and deploy it on an Arduino,
one must install these libraries first. unzip them to the libraries folder in your Arduino folder to install them.

Some of them, like TimedAction, have been slightly customized to fit the needs of Dewey, so please use these even
if they are old versions.
